**Frontend Web App (React + TypeScript)**

- A modern frontend application built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS for a freelance client. The project is currently on pause pending client feedback.

**About the Project**

- This project was created as part of a freelance contract to deliver a custom frontend solution tailored to the client’s needs. It uses React for UI development, TypeScript for static typing, and Tailwind CSS for styling.

**Tech Stack**

- React – Component-based user interface library

- TypeScript – Type-safe JavaScript for improved code quality

- Tailwind CSS – Utility-first CSS framework

- Vite– Lightning-fast development and build tooling


**Current Features**

- Modular and reusable React components

- Tailwind-based styling for rapid development

- Form handling and basic validation (if implemented)

- Initial integration with API endpoints

- Clean, maintainable code structure using TypeScript

**Responsive Design**

- Note: Responsive breakpoints have not yet been implemented.

- These will be added in the next development phase if the project resumes.

**Project Status**

- On Pause – Work is paused until further input, content, or assets are provided by the client.

**Planned Next Steps**

- Add responsive breakpoints for full mobile and tablet support

- Finalize design updates based on client feedback

- UI polish and performance optimization

- Deploy to staging or production environment

**Final Notes**

- This project serves as a solid base for a scalable and professional frontend app. Once development resumes, features like responsive layout and polish can be added efficiently.
